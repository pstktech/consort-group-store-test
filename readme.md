This implementation uses the useState hook to create a cart state variable and a setCart function to update the state. The addToCart function takes a product argument and first checks if the product already exists in the cart by using the find method to look for an item with a matching id property. If it does exist, the function updates the quantity property of the existing item using the map method to create a new array with the updated item. If it doesn't exist, the function adds the product to the cart with a quantity of 1. Note that this implementation assumes that each product has a unique id property. If your products don't have a unique identifier, you'll need to modify the implementation to use a different method for checking if a product already exists in the cart.

This implementation uses the Array.from method to create an array with 15 elements. The second argument of the Array.from method is a map function that is called for each element of the array. In this case, we're using the index parameter to generate a unique id code for each product, starting from 1.
